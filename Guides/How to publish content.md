# How to publish your contribution in Anthology-Community

Once you have your project ready and you have followed the guidelines for the README file, you can submit your contribution to the Anthology-Community organization. Here are the steps that you will need to follow:

1. Create an issue in the [Anthology-Community/Contributions](https://github.com/Anthology-Community/Contributions) repo.

2. Follow the template that is provided in the issue and fill it with the information of your project.

3. Once you have filled the template, you can submit the issue and wait for the organization to create the branch for your contribution.

4. When the branch is created, you can checkout to it and start working on your project.

5. After you finished your project, you can submit a pull request to the organization and wait for the review of your project.
